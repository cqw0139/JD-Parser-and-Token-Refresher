There are 3 inside tokens in JD Parser, all of them have 2 week life cycle. 
Everytime user uses the JD Parser will refresh the life cycle of the token.
If the token has expired, you need to use Token Refresher to refresh it.
Here are the steps:

1. 
enter the following url by any web browser

Note Token:
https://id.jobadder.com/connect/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=vzphsdtmvq4u3o4vs5pswnpk2a&scope=offline_access read write&redirect_uri=https://api.jobadder.com/v2/jobs/{jobId}/notes

Job Token:
https://id.jobadder.com/connect/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=vzphsdtmvq4u3o4vs5pswnpk2a&scope=offline_access read write&redirect_uri=https://api.jobadder.com/v2/jobs

Contact Token:
https://id.jobadder.com/connect/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=vzphsdtmvq4u3o4vs5pswnpk2a&scope=offline_access read write&redirect_uri=https://api.jobadder.com/v2/contacts

2. 
fill in the user name and password(the user must have api admin authorization)
then click login
then click accept

3.
the url will be redirect to another url with the format:
https://api.jobadder.com/v2/ABCDEF?code=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

for here, ABCDEF can be job, contact or etc.
the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX part after "code=" is the authorization code which we want

For example:
https://api.jobadder.com/v2/contacts?code=3af974b0bdebc8cee42766f6085e38e4
in this case, 3af974b0bdebc8cee42766f6085e38e4 is the authorization code which we want

fill in the code into token refresher, then click refresh

4. 
if the previous step all correct, the token refresh tool will show message "successfully refreshed" after rerfeshing the token
